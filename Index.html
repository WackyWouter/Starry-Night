                        I hope you will have a wonderful birthday! I'm sorry I
                        cant be there but know that I love you very much! I love
                        you more than the moon and the stars! I know it sucks
                        that we have had to do long distance because of Corona
                        but soon we will finally start living together. I am so
                        excited! I made this website as a gift to you, I hope
                        you like it! It shows some of my favourite places that
                        we have been together in the

                            attending the spring/summer semester at HUFS. We
                            were on that trip to the south of South-Korea. Your
                            poor back when we had to sleep on the floor üò¢.
                            Besides that it was a really fun trip and a great
                            way to meet.

                            This is one of my favourite nights in South-Korea.
                            We hung out together for almost the whole evening.
                            Talking at the bar while getting drunk. Dancing
                            together. Sitting together outside. And getting that
                            4 am McDonalds. Still a shame that that McDonalds
                            only had breakfast items. The night was too great to
                            be soured by that though. I had an amazing time!

                            After South-Korea you came to visit me on New Year
                            and celebrate it with me and my friends. It was
                            really fun hanging out with you and exploring
                            Leiden. We also decided to be official‚ù§Ô∏è. I know
                            that New Year's Eve didn't go as we had planned with
                            my friend puking and all but I still had a great

                            When Corona began, we decided in a two days that I
                            would come sit it out at your place. We thought it
                            would only last a month at max. We were very wrong
                            but it allowed us to live together for 3 months
                            which was amazing. It was stressful with school and
                            Corona but I wouldn't have wanted to do it
                            differently. It was amazing living together and I
                            can't wait to do it for real this time.

                            Because of Corona we weren't able to have the
                            vacation to Tenerife like we wanted. So we ended up
                            going for a weekend to Amsterdam. We finally had
                            air-conditioning in our hotel room. It was so much
                            better than my attic room. While in Amsterdam we had
                            so much good food. I love the pictures we took in
                            the Upside Down and the ones we took in the photo
                            booth. It was a really fun vacation. I'm glad we
                            decided to do it ‚ù§Ô∏è. We'll go to Tenerife another
