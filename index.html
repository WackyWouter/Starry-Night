                    <p>
                        I hope you will have a wonderful birthday! I'm sorry I
                        cant be there but know that I love you very much! I love
                        you more than the moon and the stars! I know it sucks
                        that we have had to do long distance because of Corona
                        but soon we will finally start living together. I am so
                        excited! I made this website as a gift to you, I hope
                        you like it! It shows some of my favourite places that
                        we have been together in the

                        together. Let's go to even more places in the future!

                            This is where it all began. We met while both
                            attending the spring/summer semester at HUFS. We
                            were on that trip to the south of South-Korea. I'm
                            extremely glad I decided to go on it otherwise I
                            would have never met you. Remember that foto we took
                            with everyone at the letters? We all look so cool
                            there! The light festival was amazing too. Everyone
                            was so tired at the end of the trip because of how
                            much we had done. Your poor back when we had to
                            sleep on the floor üò¢. Besides that, it was a really
                            fun trip and a great way to meet. Hopefully, we'll
                            be able to go back to South-Korea toghether in the
                            near future.

                            This is one of my favorite nights in South-Korea. We
                            went with the whole group to the club and got
                            pissed. We hung out together for almost the whole
                            evening. Remember singing the songs up in the bar?
                            I'm suprised we didnt get kicked out for that. We
                            were so load. And we had a lot of drinks while
                            talking at the bar. I don't remember what we talked
                            about but I do remember that I enjoyed talking to
                            you very much. After the bar we danced together,
                            which was really nice. Late in the night we also sat
                            outside together with you on my lap. I remember us
                            talking and me almost falling asleep on with my head
                            on you back. After the club we went to get that 4am
                            McDonalds. Still a shame that that McDonalds only
                            had breakfast items. The night was too great to be
                            soured by that though. I had an amazing time with
                            you! ‚ù§Ô∏è

                            After South-Korea you came to visit me on New Year
                            and celebrate it with me and my friends. I know I
                            hadn't prepared much for us to do when you came but
                            I think it worked out. It was really fun hanging out
                            with you and exploring Leiden. That Argentinian
                            steak restaurant's food was delicious. It was also
                            very fun waking up with you, hanging out all day and
                            then going to bed together. We also decided to be
                            official ‚ù§Ô∏è. We had big plans for New Year's Eve to
                            go out to Scheveningen to this cool looking club
                            after getting drunk at my place first. Sadly, It
                            didn't go as planned with my friend puking and all
                            but I still had a great time. Especially baking the
                            pancakes and playing beer pong. And thank you for
                            helping with taking care of my sick friend. I know
                            you didn't have to, and I appreciate you going out
                            of your way to do it.

                            When Corona began, we decided in two days that I
                            would come sit it out at your place. Which was
                            pretty daring as we hadn't been toghether for all
                            that long yet and we would practicly be living
                            together in a small studio appartment. We thought it
                            would only be for a few weeks, max a month but even
                            then it would have been pretty daring. But we were
                            wrong and I ended up living with you for 3 whole
                            months. After which I even went to meet your parents
                            and live with them for a week. It was stressful with
                            school and Corona but I wouldn't have wanted to do
                            it differently. It was amazing living together and I
                            can't wait to do it for real this time.

                            Because of Corona we weren't able to have the
                            vacation to Tenerife like we wanted. So, we ended up
                            going for a weekend to Amsterdam which was such a
                            good decision. We finally had air-conditioning in
                            our hotel room. It was so much better than my attic
                            room where we were almost dying even with all the
                            fans on. While in Amsterdam we had so much good
                            food. I think my favorite is probably the first food
                            we had. It's always so much fun to explore new
                            places to eat with you. We did so many fun things
                            while in Amsterdam like karaoke which was amazing. I
                            also really love the pictures we took in the Upside
                            Down and the ones we took in the photo booth. It was
                            a really fun and successful vacation also I'm very
                            happy that you ended up liking bitterballen. Not
                            sure what I would have done if you didn't like them
                            üòú. I'm glad we decided to do it ‚ù§Ô∏è. We'll go to
                            Tenerife another time üòò.
